- Time between frames 
    - figure out how long it takes for each frame
    - try to 1) reduce variance and 2) reduce mean
        - best case scenario is reduce mean so it is fast enough for realtime
        - next best case is reduce variance enough so that we can speed it up in post and still look alright
    - Right now I suspect that the lag is due to computing spacing because frames with large white space take a long time due to the while loop in wrapping the text   
        - lot's of white space means the code has to keep on scanning pixel by pixel while if it had words to fill then it could scan multiple pixels at a time
        - could probably optimise by scanning for large amounts of whitespace and then skipping that
            - e.g. if look_ahead is like 5 0's then sub in "     " and then increment pixel_count by 5 
- Add in original bad apple frames to play in a buffer in a corner window
- Add in music using EMMS
- Record and send it
